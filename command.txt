$ grep -v '^a = \s*$' <file_name> 

-v          -> used for printing on terminal
'^a = \s*$' -> removes lines which contain a = empty values 
For example   
            a = 1
            a = 2
            a = 
            a = 3
            a = 
            a = 4
Result   
            a = 1
            a = 2
            a = 3
            a = 4
